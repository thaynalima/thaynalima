## About Me 

Hey there!
My name is Thayn√°. I work at Ita√∫ Unibanco as a Quality Assurance Engineer, and I'm currently studying to become an iOS Developer.

My knowledge encompasses not only the development of iOS applications but also a solid understanding of quality testing, implementation of accessibility features that ensure an inclusive experience for all users, and other essential aspects of the software lifecycle.

I am constantly seeking new ways to improve my skills and contribute significantly to challenging projects. I am committed to technical excellence and motivated by the positive impact that my solutions can have on people's lives.
